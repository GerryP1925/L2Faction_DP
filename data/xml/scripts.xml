WHAT IS SCHEDULED SCRIPT?
 -	a way to periodicly schedule action on your server periodicly and/or certain duration
 -	scheduled script can be set to have starting and ending action or only starting action
 -	all actions may be periodicly triggered, based on the scheduled settings

HOW TO CREATE SCHEDULED SCRIPT?
 1)	Create a new script anywhere in "gameserver.scripting" package/sub-package, which inherits ScheduledQuest.
 2)	Implement onStart() and onEnd() methods (Note: onEnd() is not invocated, when having a script with one action)
	Implement init() method, when you have special conditions to start scheduling a script (e.g. config settings, etc)

HOW TO SCHEDULE SCRIPT?
 1)	Add a setup line to "scripts.xml", set up "schedule", "start" and "end" parameters
	When "schedule" parameter is not set, the script will not be scheduled
	When "end" parameter is not set, the script will only trigger onStart() method
 2)	Available configurations
